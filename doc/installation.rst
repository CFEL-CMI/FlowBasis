Installing CMItemplate
======================

Prerequisites and obtaining CMItemplate
---------------------------------------

Since CMItemplate is written in Python, you need to install Python (version 3).

In general, you should specify which Python extension packages are needed, such as

* cmiext_
* NumPy

CMItemplate is avaiable on GitHub_, please contact Jochen KÃ¼pper <jochen.kuepper@cfel.de> for
further details.


Installing CMItemplate
----------------------

A normal installation is performed by simply running the command::

  python setup.py install

However, often you do not have the administrative rights to install in global directories, or simply
do not want to overrride a global installtion. In this case, you might want to perform a local
installation in your user directory using::

  python setup.py install --user

A similar setup can be achieved using::

  python setup.py develop --user

which, however, sets up the installation in such a way that changes to your source directory are
automatically and immediately visible through the installed version. This avoids repeated
re-installs while you are developing code.

Once you are satisfied with your changes you might consider reinstalling using one of the above two
options.

Fur further details of ``develop`` install, see http://naoko.github.io/your-project-install-pip-setup


Installing CMItemplate: in user-specified path
----------------------------------------------

Use PYTHONUSERBASE to specify the installation path::

  setenv PYTHONUSERBASE $HOME/.local
  python setup.py install --user

In the above example of installation (in tcsh shell), the module will be installed in the following path::

  $HOME/.local/lib/python/site-packages

and the scripts will be installed in the following path::

  $HOME/.local/bin

To import modules and call scripts of such user-specific installation, the following environment
declarifications are required::

  setenv PATH /opt/local/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
  setenv PYTHONUSERBASE $HOME/.local

The above example is provided for the tcsh shell. You can also then use ``site`` module of python
in python command prompt to make sure the environment is properly set up. For example::

  >>> import site
  >>> site.USER_BASE
  '$HOME/.local'

Also type "which ``name of script file``" to find the real path of the script called. It should
be in "$HOME/.local/bin".
